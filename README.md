# Rocket builder
## Another HackSC misadventure - 2023 edition!

For the space exploration vertical, I want to make an educational rocket builder and launcher tool. The goal is to teach people with no rocket knowledge the basic hardware and terminology used in this field. This can inspire people, especially students, to learn more about the engineering behind these mechanical marvels and maybe even work in this space down the line.
